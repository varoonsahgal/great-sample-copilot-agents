## About This Pack

This is a complete, production-ready agent suite for EPC project teams. It covers the communication, documentation, and project management tasks most frequently required on large-scale energy projects — LNG, downstream petrochemicals, offshore, and energy transition.

Every agent in this pack:
- Defaults to formal British English
- Preserves EPC acronyms consistently (FEED, HAZOP, P&ID, ITB, FAT, IFC, MOC, SIMOPS, PSSR, etc.)
- Includes a built-in quality self-check before every response
- Includes HSE safety guardrails where applicable
